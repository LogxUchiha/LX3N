## üîß Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **OS:** Linux-based systems (e.g., Kali Linux)
- **Tools:** `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`
- **Python Version:** 3.7 or higher

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perodua-wireless-pentest-tool.git
   cd perodua-wireless-pentest-tool

Install Dependencies Ensure airmon-ng and airodump-ng are installed:

  	```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install aircrack-ng

üìö Usage
Start the Tool: Run main.py to initiate the tool.
Welcome and IP Display: Displays a welcome message and fetches your external IP address.
Enable Monitor Mode: Automatically activates monitor mode on the wlan0 interface.
Scan Networks: Captures nearby wireless networks and their details.
Enrich Data: Maps BSSIDs to manufacturers using the OUI file.
Save Results: Outputs enriched data to detailed_ap_scan_results.csv.
Disable Monitor Mode: Restores the interface to its original state.
Output Details


--- 

The CSV file contains:

BSSID: Access Point Identifier.
Channel: Wireless channel in use.
Signal Power: Strength of the signal.
Encryption: Network privacy details.
Manufacturer: Derived from OUI data.

üñ•Ô∏è Design Overview
Key Features:
Welcome Banner: Prints an ASCII art banner and displays the external IP.
Monitor Mode Management: Uses airmon-ng to enable/disable monitor mode.
Network Scanner: Executes airodump-ng for data collection.
Data Enrichment: Maps MAC prefixes to manufacturers using the OUI file.
CSV Export: Saves all results in a readable, enriched CSV format.


---

Code Flow:
Welcome and Setup: Displays info and initializes monitor mode.
Network Scanning: Captures raw wireless network data.
Data Parsing: Reads and validates the captured CSV.
Data Enrichment: Maps manufacturer information to BSSIDs.
Save and Cleanup: Outputs enriched results to a CSV and disables monitor mode.
